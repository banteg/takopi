# Tutorials

Tutorials are **step-by-step learning paths**. If you’re new, start here and follow them in order.

If you already know what you want to do (e.g. “enable topics” or “fetch a file”), jump to **How-to**.

## Before you start

You’ll need:

- A Telegram account + a bot token
- Python **3.14+** and `uv`
- At least one engine CLI on your `PATH`: `codex`, `claude`, `opencode`, or `pi`

## 1) Install and onboard

Get Takopi installed, create a bot token, capture your chat id, and pick a default engine.

- [Install & onboard](install-and-onboard.md)

## 2) Your first run

Run Takopi in a repo, send your first task from Telegram, and learn the two core controls:

- reply-to-continue (resume)
- cancel a run

- [First run](first-run.md)

## What to do next

Once you can run tasks end-to-end, you’ll usually want:

- Register a repo as a **project alias**: [How-to: Projects](../how-to/projects.md)
- Run work on a branch in a dedicated **worktree**: [How-to: Worktrees](../how-to/worktrees.md)
- Keep long-running work organized in threads: [How-to: Topics](../how-to/topics.md)

When you need exact knobs and defaults:

- [Reference: Commands & directives](../reference/commands-and-directives.md)
